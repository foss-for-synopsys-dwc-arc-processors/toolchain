# Push tag to github.

# Usage:

#     ./push-release.sh <tagname>

# Tags should be already created either with tag-release.sh or manually. This
# scrips used to be part of tag-release.sh, but has been extracted, because
# sometimes it is required to do some changes after tag has been created and it
# is easier to do so without pushing.

    # Repositories are likely to be in detached state and `git symbolic-ref
    # HEAD` will show nothing. So unlike ./tag-release.sh we use much uglier

    # "branch" output. Better solutions here are welcomed!

    # tag-release.sh updates it.
