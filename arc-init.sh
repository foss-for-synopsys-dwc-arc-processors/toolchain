#		      COMMON ARC TOOLKIT INITIALIZATION
#	              ---------------------------------

# Invocation Syntax
#	. arc-init.sh

# NOTE. Must be used by source from the calling script, not exec.

# On entry the variable ARC_GNU must be set to the source tree path, and the
# arc-versions.sh script must exist at the top of that source tree.

# This script will carry out the following actions:

# - register to trap certain signals with an error message and exit.

# - request any command failure to cause immediate exit (except where the
#   result is explicitly tested).

# - set the following environment variables to the sub-directories to be used:
#   - binutils
#   - gcc
#   - insight
#   - newlib
#   - uclibc

# - check that ARC_GNU has been defined

# - check that ${ARC_GNU}/arc-versions.sh exists, and if so exit.

# - force the shell to be bash (if available) or sh, rather than any
#   alternatives.

# - define the string "-x" in the variable addShellArgs if we were invoked
#   from bash with -x, so we can reuse this in sub-commands.

# - define the shell function calcConfigPath, to set config paths, even under
#   MinGW/MSYS which does not support symbolic links and has problems with
#   "c:/" versus "/c/".

# TODO: Is this really the set of signals intended. The original script
#       specified them numerically, and they seem like a strange selection.

# 16-Mar-12: Jeremy Bennett. Name trapped signals. Use standard format and
#            width for error messages. Force to use bash or sh instead of all
#            shells, not just tcsh. Incorporate arc-relpath.sh in this script,
#            since it is the only place it is used.

# 10-Jan-13; Jeremy Bennett. Add useful functions.
