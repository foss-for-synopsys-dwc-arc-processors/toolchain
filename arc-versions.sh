#     arc-versions.sh [--auto-checkout | --no-auto-checkout]
#                     [--auto-pull | --no-auto-pull]

# The environment variable ${ARC_GNU} should point to the directory within
# which the GIT trees live.

# Environment variables DO_UCLIBC or DO_GLIBC should be set to `yes' if Linux
# toolchain is being built.

# The environment variable ${LINUXDIR} should point to the Linux root
# directory (only used if DO_UCLIBC or DO_GLIBC is set to `yes').

# We checkout the desired branch for each tool. Note that these must exist or
# we fail.

# Default options
autocheckout="--auto-checkout"
autopull="--auto-pull"

# Parse options

# It is not safe to "pull" in the initial state, because if repository is
# currently in detached state (e.g. on a tag), then pull will fail. It is also
# not safe to checkout before fetching data, because it might be required to
# checkout branch/tag that hasn't been fetched from remote yet. Thus the
# sequence of actions is following:

# 1. Fetch
# 2. Checkout the branch/tag
# 3. Pull unless we are in a detached HEAD state.

# Steps 1 and 3 are only used if we have --auto-pull enabled.
# Step 2 is only used if we have --auto-checkout enabled.

# All this will go horribly wrong if you leave uncommitted changes lying
# around or if you change the remote. Nothing then but to sort it out by hand!
