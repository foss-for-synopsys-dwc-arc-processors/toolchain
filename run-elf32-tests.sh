#		   SCRIPT TO RUN ARC-ELF32 REGRESSION TESTS
#                  ========================================

# Usage:

#   ./run-elf32-tests.sh

# Prerequisites (NOT tested for):

#   ARC_GNU environment variable must be the absolute address of the default
#   source directory.

#   ${ARC_GNU}/logs must exist and be writable

#   ${ARC_GNU}/results must exist and be writable

# Result is 0 if successful, 1 otherwise.


# Standard setup
. "${ARC_GNU}"/toolchain/arc-init.sh

# Set up logfile and results directories if either does not exist
mkdir -p ${ARC_GNU}/logs
mkdir -p ${ARC_GNU}/results

# Run ELF32 regression and gather results. Gathering results is a separate
# function because of the variation in the location and number of results
# files for each tool.
export DEJAGNU=${ARC_GNU}/toolchain/site.exp
echo "Running elf32 tests"

# Create the ELF log file and results directory
logfile_elf="$(echo "${ARC_GNU}")/logs/elf32-check-$(date -u +%F-%H%M).log"
rm -f "${logfile_elf}"
res_elf="$(echo "${ARC_GNU}")/results/elf32-results-$(date -u +%F-%H%M)"
mkdir ${res_elf}

# Location of some files depends on endianess. For now with ELF this is
# ignored, but this code is a holding position.
