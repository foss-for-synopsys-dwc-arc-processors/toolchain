#		   SCRIPT TO BUILD ARC-LINUX-UCLIBC TOOLKIT
#		   ========================================

# Usage:

#     ${ARC_GNU}/toolchain/build_uclibc.sh [--force]

# --force

#     Blow away any old build sub-directories

# The directory in which we are invoked is the build directory, in which we
# find the unified source tree and in which all build directories are created.

# All other parameters are set by environment variables.

# ARC_GNU

#     The directory containing all the sources. If not set, this will default
#     to the directory containing this script.

# LINUXDIR

#     The directory containing the Linux source tree (needed for headers).

# UNISRC

#     The name of the unified source directory within the build directory

# INSTALLDIR

#     The directory where the tool chain should be installed

# ARC_ENDIAN

#     "big" or "little" to indicate the endianness to use.

# DISABLE_MULTILIB

#     Either --enable-multilib or --disable-multilib to control the building
#     of multilibs

# Unlike earlier versions of this script, we do not recognize the
# ARC_GNU_ONLY_CONFIGURE and ARC_GNU_CONTINUE environment variables. If you
# are using this script, you need to run the whole thing. If you want to redo
# bits, go into the relevant directories and do it by hand!

# This version is modified to work with the source tree as organized in
# GitHub.

# We source the script arc-init.sh to set up variables needed by the script
# and define a function to get to the configuration directory (which can be
# tricky under MinGW/MSYS environments).

# The script constructs a unified source directory (if --force is specified)
# and uses build directories (bd-uclibc and bd-uclibc-gdb) local to the
# directory in which it is executed. The script generates a date and time
# stamped log file in that directory.

# This approach is based on Mike Frysinger's guidelines on building a
# cross-compiler.

#     http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/CROSS-COMPILE-GUTS

# However this seems to have a basic flaw, because it relies on using sysroot,
# and for older versions of GCC (4.4.x included), the build of libgcc does not
# take any notice of sysroot.

# This has been extended to uClibc and brought up to date, using the
# install-headers targets of Linux and uClibc.

# The basic approach recommended by Frysinger is:

# 1. Build binutils
# 2. Install the Linux kernel headers
# 3. Install the uClibc headers
# 4. Build gcc stage 1 (C only)
# 5. Build uClibc
# 6. Build gcc stage 2 (C, C++ etc)

# We create a sysroot, where we can put our intermediate stuff. However there
# is a catch with GCC 4.4.7 (fixed in in GCC 4.7) that libgcc is muddled up in
# gcc and doesn't seem to recognize the sysroot. So we have to also install
# headers in the install directory before building libgcc.

# So we use a revised flow.

# 1. Install the Linux kernel headers into the temporary directory
# 2. Install uClibc headers into the temporary directory using host GCC
# 3. Build and install GCC stage 1 without headers into temporary directory
# 4. Build & install uClibc using the stage 1 compiler into the final directory
# 5. Build & install the whole tool chain from scratch (including GCC stage 2)
#    using the temporary headers

# At present the GDB binutils libraries are out of step, so GDB has to be
# built separately. gdbserver also has to be built and installed
# separately. So we add two extra steps

# 6. Build & install GDB
# 7. Build & install gdbserver
