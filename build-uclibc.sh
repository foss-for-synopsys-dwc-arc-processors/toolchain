#		   SCRIPT TO BUILD ARC-LINUX-UCLIBC TOOLKIT
#		   ========================================

# Usage:

#     ${ARC_GNU}/toolchain/build_uclibc.sh

# The directory in which we are invoked is the build directory, in which all
# build directories are created.

# All other parameters are set by environment variables.

# LOGDIR

#     Directory for all log files.

# ARC_GNU

#     The directory containing all the sources. If not set, this will default
#     to the directory containing this script.

# LINUXDIR

#     The name of the Linux directory (absolute path)

# INSTALLDIR

#     The directory where the tool chain should be installed

# ARC_ENDIAN

#     "little" or "big"

# UCLIBC_DISABLE_MULTILIB

#     Either --enable-multilib or --disable-multilib to control the building
#     of multilibs.

# UCLIBC_DEFCFG

#     The defconfig to be used when building uClibc. That should a name of file
#     that is inside uClibc/extra/Configs/defconfig/arc directory.

# ISA_CPU

#     Specifies target ARC core, can be arc700 or archs.

# CONFIG_EXTRA

#     Additional flags for use with configuration.

# CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET
# CXXFLAGS_FOR_TARGET

#     Additional flags used when building the target libraries (e.g. for
#     compact libraries) picked up automatically by make. This variable is used
#     by configure scripts and make, and build-uclibc.sh doesn't do anything
#     about it explicitly.

# DO_PDF

#     Either --pdf or --no-pdf to control whether we build and install PDFs of
#     the user guides.

# PARALLEL

#     string "-j <jobs> -l <load>" to control parallel make.

# HOST_INSTALL

#     Make target prefix to install host application. Should be either
#     "install" or "install-strip".

# NPTL_SUPPORT

#     Build with threading, thread local storage support and NPTL if this is
#     set to "yes".

# We source the script arc-init.sh to set up variables needed by the script
# and define a function to get to the configuration directory (which can be
# tricky under MinGW/MSYS environments).

# The script generates a date and time stamped log file in the logs directory.

# Approach is following:
# 1. Install Linux headers
# 2. Build and install Binutils
# 3. Build and install GCC stage 1 (without libgcc and C++)
# 4. Install uClibc headers
# 5. Build and install libgcc from GCC stage 1 build tree.
# 6. Build and install uClibc
# 7. Build and install GCC stage 2 (with C++)
# 8. Build and install GDB
# 9. Build and copy GDB-server for target and or native GDB.

# Order of things may change, there are various guides in the Internet that
# have some slightly different proposals. For example, this:
#
#   http://preshing.com/20141119/how-to-build-a-gcc-cross-compiler/
#
# proposes that we don't really need to build gcc and libgcc second time at
# stage 2. That does make sense to me, however it is important to understand
# that gcc and libgcc "configure" scripts can make different decisions based on
# what headers and binary files are already present in the installation
# location, therefore I'm not 100% sure that gcc and libgcc from stage 2 are
# identical to those from stage 1. Someone should check those things out and
# confirm or deny whether build gcc and libgcc at stage 2 is required. For now
# I stick with tried way of building gcc and libgcc twice.
#
# Another guide: http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/CROSS-COMPILE-GUTS
#
# Unlike that guide, this build script installs kernel headers before doing
# anything else, for reasons that are explained in the historical note further
# down, and apparently that may not be needed anymore.
#

# Following after this paragraph text, is a text of historical significance
# that described how things used to be done in the age of ARC GCC 4.4 and early
# days of ARC GCC 4.8. Things changed since then so this is not totally
# relevant today, but explains how things evolved, since some things today can
# be done differently then they are done right now, because it was an evolution
# of previous decisions. For example it seems that we can install Linux and
# uClibc headers after stage 1 instead of doing this as a first step.  Although
# that might be true in general, but not for ARC, since our libgcc depends on
# libc headers. To be completely honest I haven't read this header guide while
# modifying toolchain to support sysroot and avoid unified source tree, as I
# was just looking at the code itself, and was completely oblivious to the
# presence of this gentoo web-guide... (On the matter of comments in code: will
# anybody read this???).

# << How it used to be done: >>

# This approach is based on Mike Frysinger's guidelines on building a
# cross-compiler.

#     http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/CROSS-COMPILE-GUTS

# However this seems to have a basic flaw, because it relies on using sysroot,
# and for older versions of GCC (4.4.x included), the build of libgcc does not
# take any notice of sysroot.

# This has been extended to uClibc and brought up to date, using the
# install-headers targets of Linux and uClibc.

# The basic approach recommended by Frysinger is:

# 1. Build binutils
# 2. Install the Linux kernel headers
# 3. Install the uClibc headers
# 4. Build gcc stage 1 (C only)
# 5. Build uClibc
# 6. Build gcc stage 2 (C, C++ etc)

# We create a sysroot, where we can put our intermediate stuff. However there
# is a catch with GCC 4.4.7 (fixed in in GCC 4.7) that libgcc is muddled up in
# gcc and doesn't seem to recognize the sysroot. So we have to also install
# headers in the install directory before building libgcc.

# So we use a revised flow.

# 1. Install the Linux kernel headers into the temporary directory
# 2. Install uClibc headers into the temporary directory using host GCC
# 3. Build and install GCC stage 1 without headers into temporary directory
# 4. Build & install uClibc using the stage 1 compiler into the final directory
# 5. Build & install the whole tool chain from scratch (including GCC stage 2)
#    using the temporary headers

# We build GDB after GCC. gdbserver also has to be built and installed
# separately. So we add two extra steps

# 6. Build & install GDB
# 7. Build & install gdbserver
