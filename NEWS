This release of GNU toolchain and IDE is supported by CGEN IPlib (TCF
generator) version 1.0.53.


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------

* Binutils
    * Binutils for ARC has been rewritten from the scratch, based on upstream
      release 2.26.
* GCC
    * New values for `-mcpu` option and new set of multilib libraries built for
      those processor configurations.
    * Support for text values of `-mmpy-option`, same as in hardware IP
      libraries.
    * Fixed runtime issues on 32-bit hosts.
* Eclipse IDE
    * Support for new GCC `-mcpu` option values.
    * If TCF is used, then options in GUI are now synchronized with it.
    * Now it is possible to select current working directory when using nSIM.
* OpenOCD
    * Added a separate configuration file for ARC EM Starter Kit v2.2, which
      requries reduced JTAG Frequency of 5 MHz, compared to 7.5 MHz that has
      been used for versions 2.0 and 2.1.
* Toolchain build scripts
    * Option `--cpu` now accepts different values that are supported by GCC as
      values for `-mcpu` option. List of supported values is dynamic and
      evaluated based on GCC configuration.
    * Support for building of native (self-hosting) Linux/uClibc toolchain.
    * New option of build-all.sh script:
	* `--native` - specifies whether script is building native
	  (self-hosting) toolchain. That affects location of header files and
	  standard library archvies. It is still required to pass `--host`
	  option to specify cross-toolchain to build native toolchain.


Bugs Fixed in This Release (Summary)
------------------------------------

* GCC
    * There was no multilib configuration without multiplier for ARC 700, EM
      and HS processors.
* Newlib
    * Fixed a bug in crt0.S file that was using optional ASR a,b,u6 instruction
      without checking if barrel shifter is enabled.
* Eclipse IDE
    * Path to standard headers was calculated improperly for big-endian
      projects.
    * Fixed an inconsistency where if toolchain is present both in the PATH and
      relatively to eclipse installation, compiler plugin would use one
      toolchain from ../bin to build project, but would use toolchain from the
      PATH to get information about standard headers.
* OpenOCD
    * OpenOCD didn't worked with HS36 in AXS103.
* Toolchain build scripts
    * XML files for Ashling Opella-XD GDBserver were broken for Windows systems.
    * Memory maps for AXS10x boards were broken - there was a link error when
      using them.


Major changes in 2015.12 release
================================

Toolchain and IDE Components Versions
-------------------------------------

* GCC v4.8.5
* Binutils v2.23
* newlib v2.3
* uclibc (upstream HEAD at the moment of release)
* GDB 7.10
* Eclipse Mars (4.5.1) with CDT 8.8.0
* OpenOCD 0.9+ upstream commit 30203b3d8b, with ARC support.

New Features and Enhancements
----------------------------------------------

* GCC
    * Source update to v4.8.5
    * New preprocessor defines for processor optional features, like -mnorm,
      -mll64, etc.
    * Fast interrupt (FIRQ) function attribute support
    * Naked function attribute support
* GDB
    * Updated to upstream 7.10 release.
* Pre-built binaries
    * Baremetal toolchain now contains additional set of libc/libstdc++ binaries
      compiled with optimization for code size. Can be selected by passing
      `--specs=nano.specs` to gcc.
    * Standard libraries in baremetal toolchain are now stripped of debug
      information, except for `.debug_frame` section.
    * Linux toolchain for ARC HS now contains sysroot for ARC 700. It is now
      possible to build ARC 700 application using ARC HS toolchain, by passing
      an option `--sysroot=$INSTALLDIR/arc-snps-linux-uclibc/sysroot-arc700` to
      arc-linux-gcc, where `$INSTALLDIR` is a path to toolchain installation
      folder. This is implemented for both little end big endian toolchains.
    * Toolchain binaries are linked dynamically
* Eclipse IDE
    * Removed redundant "hostname" text field from debugger configuration when
      locally started gdbserver are used.
    * ARC template projects have been reorganized. They are now grouped by
      target ARC development system.
    * Added validation for text fields in debugger configuration.
    * TCF support to build configurations
    * Debugger configuration UI now has a full support of Synopsys ARC
      development systems for OpenOCD
    * Reworked template projects for Synopsys ARC development systems
    * Updated processor option in compiler pluging to adhere to GCC in this
      release
* Newlib
    * Updated to upstream 2.3 release
    * Added support for newlib-nano
* OpenOCD
    * Support for the actionpoints. OpenOCD will automatically detect actions
      points in ARC EM and ARC HS targets. Hardware breakpoints are set via GDB
      command `hbreak`, while hardware watchpoints via GDB command `watch`.
* Toolchain build scripts
    * 2-stage build process for baremetal toolchain
    * Can now build libc and libstdc++ optimized for size along the "normal" set
      of libraries.
    * Support for Linux toolchains with multiple sysroots. Buildscripts
      themselves can build a toolchain with only one sysroot, however that
      arc-snps-linux-uclibc/sysroot folder may be now freely used with other
      toolchains. That wasn't possible with previous releases, because some
      libraries were outside of the sysroot.
    * New options of build-all.sh script:
	* `--[no-]elf32-gcc-stage1` - defines whether to build of stage 1
	  compiler for baremetal toolchain. Means that runnable ARC compiler
	  should be already in the PATH to build newlib. Disable first stage
	  compiler is needed for canadian cross builds. Default is
	  `--elf32-gcc-stage1`.
	* `--[no-]optsze-newlib` - defines whether to build newlib optimized for
	  code size. Default is `--optsize-newlib`.
	* `--[no-]optsze-libstdc++` - defines whether to build libstdc++
	  optimized for code size. Default is `--optsize-libstdc++`. This is
	  independent from newlib option, however nano.specs will be copied to
	  target toolchain installation only when `--optsize-newlib` is used.
	* `--[no-]elf32-strip-target-libs` - defines whether to string target
	  libraries of the debug symbols (except for .debug_frame section).
	  Default is off `--no-elf32-strip-target-libs`.


Bugs Fixed  in This Release (Summary)
----------------------------------------

* Pre-built binaries
    * Fixed broken shortcut to documentation folder in installer for Windows
    * Fixed a bug where uninstaller for Windows wouldn't remove some shortcuts
* Eclipse IDE
    * Fixed compatibility with Ashling Opella-XD gdbserver
    * Fixed an case where in C++ projects standard library functions were
      highlighted as unknown by Eclipse syntax checker.
    * Fix crash in IDE on Linux when connecting to target UART
    * Fixed: IDE template projects for C++ were not linking
    * Fixed: printf() is highlighted by Eclipse as an unknown function in C++
      project, but projects builds without error
* Newlib
    * Fixed an issue with string and memory routines using instructions which
      are not available for selected ARC processor configuration.
* OpenOCD
    * Fixed support of EM7DFPU image in EM Starter Kit 2.1: JTAG frequency was
      too high.
* Toolchain build scripts
    * Fixed an issue where custom baremetal toolchain built with -mnorm option
      wouldn't link C++ applications


Major changes in 2015.06 release
================================

Build process:
- Added NPTL Support (--nptl/--no-nptl options of build-all.sh). NPTL is now
  default threading library for Linux uClibc toolchain.
- Major change in toolchain build process - unified source tree is not used
  anymore. Options --unisrc/--no-unisrc removed.
- Added custom "configuration" files, that contain branches to be checked out.
  Option --checkout-config added.
- Added --host option to build-all.sh that allows to choose runtime host of
  toolchain build. That allows to do a Canadian cross build without modifying
  build scripts.
- Linux is now configured out of source tree.
- Error during PDF documentation build on RHEL 6
- Improve performance of branch checkout phase.
- It is now not required to copy `auto-host.h` file while doing Canadian
  cross-build for Windows - root bug in GCC has been fixed.
- Removed support for the old style uClibc "full" configurations, only defconfig
  is supported now.
- Removed option `--force`.
- Changed default Linux branch from 3.13 to 3.18.
- Added a new "TCF" wrapper for GCC. Script `arc-elf32-tcf-gcc` accepts `--tcf`
  option with path to TCF file, from which GCC options will be automatically
  extracted. Compatible TCF file is required (compatible TCF file have
  "gcc_compiler" section).

Release process:
- Extracted push-release.sh script from tag-release.sh.
- Makefile.release now automatically builds Linux IDE release tarball.
- Windows installer build script now automatically installs ARC plugins to
  vanilla Eclipse and creates installers after that.
- Changed naming convention of release tarballs to ensure consistent naming
  across different products: arc_gnu_{release}_{product}[_{os}_install].
- Automated process of OpenOCD building for release.
- Components in Windows installer can now be installed separately.

DejaGNU boards:
- Added DejaGNU board for OpenOCD.
- Fix numerous issues with nSIM-GDB DejaGNU board
