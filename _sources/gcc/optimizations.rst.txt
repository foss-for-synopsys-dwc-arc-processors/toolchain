Understanding compiler options
==============================

There are cases when using solely the -Ox options will not bring the desired
optimization (either size or speed) for a compiled function/application. In
these cases we need to understand where is the program's bottleneck and if it
can be solved either by passing various options to the compiler or by source
code modifications. In this section, we look into compiler's command-line
options and how they can help us in achieving better results.


Architecture-Independent Optimizations
--------------------------------------

The first step in optimizing your code is by experimenting with
architecture-independent optimizations. Almost any GCC pass (i.e., optimization)
can be turned on or off or steered using parameters. These optimizations are
denoted by the notation -f*xxxx*, where *xxxx* is the GCC pass that is turned on.
To turn off a gcc pass, we need to pass -fno-*xxxx* to the compiler. The same
observation holds for other types of optimizations such as the
architecture-specific ones. For more information about GCC options, please check
the `GCC manual <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Option-Summary.html#Option-Summary>`_.
It is highly desirable to know and understand how these options work in order to
properly use them.

To avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer amount of options available, I use for
my day-to-day source code exploration the following tree related options (either
on or off):

``-ftree-loop-ivcanon``
   Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which
   determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis. Later
   optimizations then may determine the number easily. Useful especially in
   connection with unrolling.

``-ftree-vectorize``
   Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at -O3.
   This option is useful to use either if the ARC processor doesn't have the
   SIMD extensions as it performs extra code analysis and may improve the
   following optimizations.

``-ftree-loop-if-convert``
   Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to branch-less
   equivalents. The intent is to remove control-flow from the innermost loops in
   order to improve the ability of the vectorization pass to handle these loops.
   This is enabled by default if vectorization is enabled.

``-f[no-]tree-dominator-opts``
   Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy propagation,
   redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression simplification)
   based on a dominator tree traversal. This also performs jump threading (to
   reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is enabled by default at -O and higher.

``-f(no-)ivopts``
   Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
   variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees. Disabling the
   ``ivopts`` optimization may improve the number of hardware loops recognized by
   the compiler.

``-fselective-scheduling``
   Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm. Selective
   scheduling runs instead of the first scheduler pass.

``-fgcse``
   Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass. This pass also
   performs global constant and copy propagation. It may be useful to disable
   this step specially when we want to have more SUB1/2/3, ADD1/2/3 type of
   operations generated.

``-frename-registers``
   Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use of
   registers left over after register allocation. This optimization most
   benefits processors with lots of registers. Depending on the debug
   information format adopted by the target, however, it can make debugging
   impossible, since variables no longer stay in a "home register". Enabled by
   default with ``-funroll-loops`` and ``-fpeel-loops``.

``-fira-loop-pressure``
   Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions to move loop
   invariants. This option usually results in generation of faster and smaller
   code on machines with large register files (>= 32 registers), but it can slow
   the compiler down.

``-fsched-pressure``
   Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before register
   allocation. This only makes sense when scheduling before register allocation
   is enabled, i.e. with ``-fschedule-insns``. Usage of this option can improve
   the generated code and decrease its size by preventing register pressure
   increase above the number of available hard registers and subsequent spills
   in register allocation.

``-f[no-]regmove``
   Attempt to reassign register numbers in move instructions and as operands of
   other simple instructions in order to maximize the amount of register tying.
   This is especially helpful on machines with two-operand instructions.
   Disabling this optimization may result in faster code.


Processor-Specific Optimizations
--------------------------------

ARC GCC specific backend switches can be used to improve the code size or code
speed. We need always to use the ARC switches that enables usage of the hardware
extensions (such as -mdiv-rem). An overview of those options can be found in
ARC's gcc manual or by invoking gcc with ``--help=target``. Additionally, I use
the next switches to enable better handling of LD/ST operations:

``-mindexed-loads``
   Enable the use of indexed loads.  This can be problematic because some
   optimizers will then assume that indexed stores exist, which is not the case.

``-mauto-modify-reg``
   Enable the use of pre/post modify with register displacement.


GCC optimizations for Code Size
-------------------------------

If code size is our target, beside the GCC's -Os option, it may make sense to
use it in conjunction with following command-line options:

* ``-fsection-anchors``
* ``-fno-branch-count-reg``
* ``-fira-loop-pressure``
* ``-fira-region=all``
* ``-fno-sched-spec-insn-heuristic``
* ``-fno-move-loop-invariants``
* ``-fno-tree-dominator-opts``
* ``-ftree-vectorize``
* ``-fno-cse-follow-jumps``
* ``-fno-jump-tables``

I would advise compiling a program with -O2 and -Os and comparing runtime
performance and memory footprint. It may be that the code is as fast as compiled
with -O2 but smaller due to -Os option.


GCC optimization for speed
--------------------------

If the cycle count is our target, the best is to start with -O2 option then with
-O3 and for each compiler optimization level to combine one or more of the
suggested GCC command-line options. Finally, gather and compare runtime
performance and size for each command-line combination. I suggest to plot these
numbers on a 2-D graph, where one axis will represent the cycle count, and the
other will represent the size. Hence, we can choose the best combination
size/speed for a given problem.

If one wants to try a large number of option combinations, then an automatic
scripting process is required. One of those tools that searches through more
than 1.3 zillion gcc option combination is `Acovea
<https://github.com/Acovea/libacovea>`_. Acovea is using genetic algorithms to
search for the best option combination for a given program.  However, one can
make an script that uses only the suggested gcc options to search for the best
combination by exhaustively generating (most) of the option combinations.


Using _optimize_ attribute
--------------------------

In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your program
which help the compiler optimize function calls and check your code more
carefully. In the case when we want a certain function/kernel not to change its
speed/size characteristics, we can use the _optimize_ function attribute. The
_optimize_ attribute is used to specify that a function is to be compiled with
different optimization options than specified on the command line. Arguments can
either be numbers or strings. Numbers are assumed to be an optimization level.
Strings that begin with O are assumed to be an optimization option, while other
options are assumed to be used with a -f prefix.
